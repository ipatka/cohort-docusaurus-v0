# Skills

The skillz dat pay da billz. Explain how this came together organically and what we are capable of.

Each apprentice in the cohort has a tremendous amount of skill from our unique backgrounds. We needed a way to gain insight into each other's strengths and knowledge so that we could begin working together. We were aided in this process by an open source [Discord Skillbot created by MetaFam](https://github.com/MetaFam/skill-bot).

The skillbot runs in the Raid Guild Season 1 "ðŸ› -skills" channel where cohort apprentices added new skills and then self-identified as having each skill. Season 1 Apprentice **tenfinney** created a usage guide. Check it out here: [RaidGuild Releases a SkillBot](https://hackmd.io/Fs_mnbS3R1qt3MXCyHwwew?view)
