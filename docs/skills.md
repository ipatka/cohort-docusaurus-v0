# Skills

The skillz dat pay da billz. Explain how this came together organically and what we are capable of.

## Why?

Each apprentice in the cohort has a tremendous amount of skill from our unique backgrounds. We needed a way to gain insight into each other's strengths and knowledge so that we could begin working together. We were aided in this process by an open source [Discord Skillbot created by MetaFam](https://github.com/MetaFam/skill-bot).

## How?

The skillbot runs in the Raid Guild Season 1 "ðŸ› -skills" channel where cohort apprentices added new skills and then self-identified as having each skill. The skill bot creates a _map_ of skills and the members who identified as having each one. This map is an effective way to visually process the skills of the cohort, and where our strengths are. This is an effective way to form parties and squads where we can round out each other's strengths.

## Going Further

Season 1 Apprentice **tenfinney** created a usage guide. Check it out here: [RaidGuild Releases a SkillBot](https://hackmd.io/Fs_mnbS3R1qt3MXCyHwwew?view).
