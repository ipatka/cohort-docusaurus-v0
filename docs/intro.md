# Documentation

We cannot emphasize the importance of documentation enough. The better we track and share our journeys and key learnings the easier it is to help others along their paths.

This is where we record the information required for using our tools, the skills of our apprentices and ideas for improving our W3 Site Template project.

## Skills

Navigating the Ethereum ecosystem requires an extensive toolbox of technology skills. tenfinney has been working hard to organize the capabilities of our cohort and resources for leveling up.

## Memes

Raid Guild has an exceptional capacity to propagate culture. This is where we have recorded the work of some of our information transfer specialists.

## Features

These are the components we currently offer.

## Usage

This is how you get started using our tool.

## Improvements

This project was created in an on-boarding sprint. Our goal was to keep it simple, prove the concept then identify what is required to develop a template we can share with the world. Good ideas have been omitted to limit the scope. But we love the enthusiasm and hope to collect the enhancements for future prioritization. Please do not hesitate to share your thoughts on what we should consider.
