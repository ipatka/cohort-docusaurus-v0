## A Raid Guild Adventure

You awaken in a strange and empty land. Legend tells of demons that abide here, and the riches they reward. Endless blankness on the horizon, except for a warm glow emanating from a cavern nearby.

### follow the light

You approach the glowing cavern. An oaken door stands open before you, allowing cozy firelight to flicker on the sign hanging above the entrance which reads “RAIDGUILD: Slaying Web3 Product Demons.”

### enter cozy place

You enter, as your curiosity gets the better of you, and you wish to learn more of this mystical “Web3” and its demons. Within is a cozily decorated tavern with odd curios and legendary gear adorning the walls.

A handsome bartender waves at you graciously.

### order a drink

“Well met, friend! You must be some kind of an adventurer to have reached this strange land. There are many demons, but with good help, they can be slain for loot and XP aplenty!”

### take me to your leader

“We don’t have leaders here at RaidGuild (they tend to spoil the fun). We hold the principles of the DAO which keeps the loot flowing and the fire glowing. If you wish to join an adventure, you must seek out a Cleric! Follow along with me, and I’ll introduce you to a few of our roles!”

The Cleric summons a raiding party, using clairvoyant rituals to seek out the talent necessary for the demon to be slain. Once the party is assembled, the Cleric makes sure that all bases are covered to slay a particular demon.

The Warrior is a strong and necessary member of the Raid party. They charge headfirst into the front of the battle, wielding HTML, CSS, React, and other Front End weapons.

While the warrior is occupied with the front, the noble Paladin makes sure the vanguard is secure by developing the Back End through Java, Python, Rust, Node, or other skills!

An Archer has a keen eye for visual detail, and are necessary for demons which require artistic prowess to conquer. Archers are creative and original thinkers with a mind for design.

The Wizard is an arcane master, wielding the power of Smart Contracts to command the heart of many Web3 demons! Their scrolls contain the script of Solidity, Vyper, and other cutting edge languages.

Rangers are adventurous souls who take demons into the wild, searching them for weaknesses through user testing and UX knowledge. They track down the best ways to broaden an audience through the wilds of statistical data.

The Druid meditates and finds answers in the endless streams of data, sifting for meaningful answers on demon-slaying techniques through data science and SEO wisdom.

Necromancers is the bridge between different worlds, responsible for bringing dead code to life through deep knowledge of configuration and optimization.

At last, the party is assembled. The tavern keeper smiles approvingly as you and your merry band of Raiders stand ready to enter the Void of WEB3. “Go forth and SLAY!”

To be continued...
