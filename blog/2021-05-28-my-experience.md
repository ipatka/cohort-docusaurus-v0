## Raid Guild's Season One Cohort

I have been at the edge of the cryptocurrency space for awhile but over the last few months I have started to dig deeper into Web3, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). I have always been interested in different ways of working so after learning about Gitcoin, and idling the chat for a few weeks, I accidentally learned about the Raid Guild. This is is a group of people who work in a DAO building Web3 client projects. My post today covers the two week process of applying to The Guild and working through the Season.

### The application process

The application process is straightforward and follows a structure similar to many online job applications: who you are, your skills, and your interests. A deconstructed resume with no shits given for who you've worked for.

If you're interested in joining, head over to [Raid Guild](https://raidguild.org/join).

I got super lucky here, I think. I had been idling in the Gitcoin Discord for a couple weeks. Scrolling through messages, I saw a short message about the cohort starting soon. After sitting on that for a couple days, I saw a message somewhere else that the cohort starts the next day so I hastily filled out the application and crossed my fingers. Somehow I got in.

### Week One

The week kicked off with an introduction meeting, called the Pilot Episode. Season One had a large cohort and was distributed across the world so two meetings were set up for the Monday. The Pilot Episode covered pretty much everything in [The Handbook](https://handbook.raidguild.org/) so, having read that and Season Zero slides, I didn't pick up too much new information. That being said, I got to meet roughly half the cohort and sticking around for the Question and Answer period was very beneficial.

Following the Pilot, I attended a couple of the optional meetings: non-technical intro and technical intro. Both of these were meet and greet style meetings but included more members from Raid Guild to help the cohort get an idea of what work was out there and a little more about what was expected if someone made it into the Guild. At this time, there was also a call for Typescript developers to help on projects. This is when I met peth from MetaGame. I got a quick introduction to the task list for MyMeta and then was set loose on the code. The team was extremely helpful in sharing documentation and an hour long code walk through.

The next "mandatory" meeting was Episode One. I use quotes on mandatory because no one is contractually obligated. Anyways, there are usually slides sent out afterwards if the meeting is missed. Episode One introduced us to exactly what was expected of us for the duration of the cohort. We were introduced to the task list which included short projects for us to group up on and build. This was on Thursday so for a few people, myself included, this seemed like a bit short notice. Keep this in mind if you are applying, you might want to try and clear your schedule as much as possible.

### Week Two

The week kicks off with Episode Two: The Episoding. The big news in this meeting was that the cohort was getting a special DAO just for us. The DAO would give the cohort the ability to practice the mechanics of a MolochDao as well as a place to control. Anyone can see how the DAO is operating on DaoHaus.

At the end of Week One, I was tapped about joining a raid. Because of this, I decided to opt-out of working on any projects that were proposed in Episode 1. This was a mistake! These two weeks are a great time to build some relationships and work on cool stuff in a short time frame. I spent the weekend and Monday/Tuesday of Week Two watching from the sidelines. On Tuesday, I decided to not wait for a raid that wasn't quite ready yet and face-dive into one of the projects.

Looking through the project channels, I found that a Job Board project had a low number of people. I figured this was a good place to help out and I am glad I did. I got to talk to some cool people, see some new code, and stretch my (non-existent) frontend skills. Since this project started a bit late, we didn't quite have a working application by the end of the Season but the team is coming together next week to discuss future plans. Very excited about this.

On the side, throughout this week, I worked on a ticket for MyMeta to get and display information about DAOs a player was part of. This existed for Ethereum mainnet so I extended the existing code to support xDai and Polygon. I finally got the Pull Request up for review before the end of this season.

### Season End

We're not there yet! I'm publishing this on the final day so that I can participate in one of the other cohort projects. Today is demo day and that should be fun. We'll also learn a bit more about how we get ready for raids, which is what we will need to do to be championed by a Raid Guild member. Proving our metal is the name of the game.

I think this was really fun and definitely worth the time. I am going to keep working away to try and become a full member of the guild. Participating in the future of work is great.
